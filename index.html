            For me, the ideal life consists of traveling, <br>
            cycling and programming. This is what I strive for) <br>
            To achieve what I want at the moment, <br>
            I am studying at the Stage-0 course from Rolling Scopes, <br>
            I study the skills of non-noob urban cycling and <br>
            periodically I envy those who do not live in such boring steppes <br>
            <br>
            I wrote a little in C++, Shell (both Windows Powershell and Linux Bash), <br>
            just a little bit in Java. Basically, the programs were of the level <br>
            initial laboratory work on studies. I had experience working with Git, I posted it there <br>
            joint project (evolventa-tmn.github.io) <br>

            Last time I worked here: 404 NOT FOUND <br>

            I graduated from high school with a degree in mathematics and physics, <br>
            at the moment I am studying at OmSU. At first there was <br>
            at the Faculty of Mathematics, now - computer Science <br>

            I evaluate myself on Pre-Intermediate, but I did not pass the tests <br>
