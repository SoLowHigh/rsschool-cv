            For me, the ideal life consists of traveling, 
            cycling and programming. This is what I strive for) 
            To achieve what I want at the moment, I am studying at the Stage-0 course from Rolling Scopes, 
            I study the skills of amateur urban cycling and 
            periodically I envy those who do not live in such boring steppes 

            I wrote a little in C++, Shell (both Windows Powershell and Linux Bash), 
            just a little bit in Java. Basically, the programs were of the level 
            initial laboratory work on studies. I had experience working with Git, I posted it there 
            joint project (evolventa-tmn.github.io)

            at the Faculty of Mathematics, now - computer Science 

            I evaluate myself on Pre-Intermediate, but I did not pass the tests
