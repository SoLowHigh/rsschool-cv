                    <h2>&gt;_ Bio</h2>
                    For me, the ideal life consists of traveling,  
                    cycling and programming. This is what I strive for)  
                    To achieve what I want at the moment,  
                    I am studying at the Stage-0 course from Rolling Scopes,  
                    I study the skills of non-noob urban cycling and  
                    periodically I envy those who do not live in such boring steppes
                    <h2>&gt;_ Skills</h2>
                    I wrote a little in C++, Shell (both Windows Powershell and Linux Bash),  
                    just a little bit in Java. Basically, the programs were of the level  
                    initial laboratory work on studies. I had experience working with Git, I posted it there

                    I graduated from high school with a degree in mathematics and physics,  
                    at the moment I am studying at OmSU. At first there was  
                    at the Faculty of Mathematics, now - computer Science  
                    <h2>&gt;_ English level</h2>
                    I evaluate myself on Pre-Intermediate, but almost whole text has been 
                    translated with <a href="https://translate.ya.ru">Ya.Perevodchik</a> by myself
